ROCm is an open-source stack, composed primarily of open-source software, designed for graphics processing unit (GPU) computation. ROCm consists of a collection of drivers, development tools, and APIs that enable GPU programming from low-level kernel to end-user applications.

With ROCm, you can customize your GPU software to meet your specific needs. You can develop, collaborate, test, and deploy your applications in a free, open source, integrated, and secure software ecosystem. ROCm is particularly well-suited to GPU-accelerated high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), scientific computing, and computer aided design (CAD).

ROCm is powered by AMDâ€™s Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP), an open-source software C++ GPU programming environment and its corresponding runtime. HIP allows ROCm developers to create portable applications on different platforms by deploying code on a range of platforms, from dedicated gaming GPUs to exascale HPC clusters.

ROCm supports programming models, such as OpenMP and OpenCL, and includes all necessary open source software compilers, debuggers, and libraries. ROCm is fully integrated into machine learning (ML) frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.Key Components of ROCm:

  * ROCm Runtime: ROCm includes a runtime that provides the necessary low-level GPU support, including hardware abstraction, memory management, and kernel execution. It allows developers to write and execute GPU-accelerated code using a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, and Python.

  * ROCm Math Libraries (RocBLAS, RocFFT, etc.): ROCm provides a suite of math libraries optimized for AMD GPUs. These libraries include linear algebra routines (RocBLAS), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations (RocFFT), and more. They are crucial for scientific and engineering applications.

  * HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability): HIP is a key component of ROCm that allows developers to write GPU-accelerated code in a way that can be easily ported between AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. It offers a high-level API and tools for GPU application development.

  * ROCr (ROCm Runtime API): ROCr is an API that provides low-level control and management of AMD GPUs. It allows developers to interact directly with the GPU hardware and execute custom kernels.

  * ROCProfiler: ROCProfiler is a profiling tool that helps developers analyze the performance of GPU-accelerated code. It provides insights into kernel execution times, memory usage, and other performance metrics.

  * ROCTracer: This tool enables fine-grained GPU kernel tracing and profiling, making it easier to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize GPU code.

  * ROCm SMI (System Management Interface): ROCm SMI allows users to monitor and manage the health and performance of AMD GPUs. It provides information about GPU temperature, power consumption, and other metrics.

Supported Frameworks:

ROCm is compatible with popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. This compatibility allows researchers and data scientists to leverage the power of AMD GPUs for training and inference in machine learning models.

ROCm Use Cases:

4. Install mesa-opencl-icd
```bash
sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd -y
```

clinfo is a command-line utility that provides detailed information about OpenCL (Open Computing Language) platforms and devices available on your system. It displays information such as the number of OpenCL platforms, the types of devices (e.g., GPUs, CPUs) supported by each platform, their capabilities, and other relevant details. clinfo is commonly used by developers and users to inspect and diagnose OpenCL configurations on their systems, helping them understand the available computing resources for GPU-accelerated applications and tasks.

5. Install and check clinfo
```bash
sudo apt install clinfo -y
```

6. Check clinfo:
```bash

mesa-opencl-icd is an implementation of the OpenCL (Open Computing Language) ICD (Installable Client Driver) for Mesa, an open-source graphics library. It allows software applications to utilize OpenCL for GPU-accelerated computing tasks on systems with Mesa-supported graphics hardware. This package helps bridge the gap between Mesa's graphics capabilities and OpenCL, enabling developers to run OpenCL applications on systems using Mesa graphics drivers.

## Repo setup
1. Install git
```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

2. Clone repo containing hello world files
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vampireLibrarianMonk/amd-gpu-hello.git
```

## Python environment setup via Mamba Environment Manager
Substitute conda for mamba.
[Command Cheat Sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/conda-cheat-sheet)

1. Weâ€™ll use the Mamba package manager to create the Python environment. You can learn more about it in my getting started tutorial.

The following bash commands will download the latest release, install it, and relaunch the current bash shell to apply the relevant changes:
```bash
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh -b
~/mambaforge/bin/mamba init
bash
```

### Pytorch

1. Create torch mamba environment
```bash
mamba create --name pytorch-rocm python=3.10 -y
mamba activate pytorch-rocm
```

2. Install [reference](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/install/install-pytorch.html)
```bash
pip install --pre torch==2.3.0.dev20240110+rocm5.7 torchvision==0.18.0.dev20240110+rocm5.7 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm5.7/
```

3. Verify if Pytorch is installed and detecting the GPU compute device.
```bash
python3 -c 'import torch' 2> /dev/null && echo 'Success' || echo 'Failure'
```

Result: 
```bash
Success
```

4. Enter command to test if the GPU is available.
```bash
python3 -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
```

Result:
```bash
True
```

5. Enter command to display installed GPU device name.
```bash
python3 -c "import torch; print(f'device name [0]:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

Result:
```bash
device name [0]: Radeon RX 7900 XTX
```

6. Run the preliminary hello world
```bash
python pytorch_mnist_numbers.py 
```

Result:
```bash
```

### Tensorflow
1. Create tensorflow mamba environment
```bash
mamba create --name tensorflow-rocm python=3.10 -y
mamba activate tensorflow-rocm
```

2. Was told to use this build in lieu of all the other version issues recently experienced.
Issues encountered was missing comma keeping gfx1100 from being a valid card.
```bash
pip install http://ml-ci.amd.com:21096/job/tensorflow/job/nightly-rocmfork-develop-upstream/job/nightly-build-whl/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/packages-3.10/tf_nightly_rocm-2.16.0.600.dev20240109-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```

3. Had to install this library as well
```bash
pip install requests
```

4. Default way I test if tensorflow can see the GPU
```bash
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

5. Run the preliminary hello world
```bash
python tensorflow-rocm.py 
```

Result:
```bash
```
