## ROCm and driver installation

1. Make the directory if it doesn't exist yet. This location is recommended by the distribution maintainers.
```bash
sudo mkdir --parents --mode=0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
```

2. Download the key, convert the signing-key to a full keyring required by apt and store in the keyring directory.
```bash
wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key -O - | \
    gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg > /dev/null
```

3. Register kernel-mode driver. Add the AMDGPU repository for the driver.
```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu/6.0/ubuntu jammy main" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/amdgpu.list
sudo apt update
```

4. Register ROCm packages and add the ROCm repository.
```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/6.0 jammy main" \
    | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
echo -e 'Package: *\nPin: release o=repo.radeon.com\nPin-Priority: 600' \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/rocm-pin-600
```

5. Install kernel driver
```bash
sudo apt install amdgpu-dkms
```

6. Reboot.
```bash
sudo reboot
```

7. Install ROCm packages
```bash
sudo apt install rocm-hip-sdk
```

8. Instruct the system linker where to find shared objects (.so-files) for ROCm applications.
```bash
sudo tee --append /etc/ld.so.conf.d/rocm.conf <<EOF
/opt/rocm/lib
/opt/rocm/lib64
EOF
sudo ldconfig
```

9. Add the current user to the "render" and "video" groups.
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G render,video $LOGNAME
```

10. Note that rocm-libs and rccl are related to AMD's ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform, which is an open-source framework for GPU computing on AMD GPUs. Here's a brief explanation of each:
    
  * rocm-libs: rocm-libs stands for ROCm Libraries.
    
    * These libraries are part of the ROCm software stack, which is designed to provide an open-source GPU compute platform for AMD GPUs.
      
    * ROCm Libraries include various GPU-accelerated libraries and tools for high-performance computing (HPC), scientific computing, machine learning, and deep learning workloads.
      
    * Some of the key libraries included in rocm-libs are ROCm Math Libraries (RocBLAS, rocSOLVER, etc.), ROCm Communication Libraries (RCCL, HIPCL, etc.), and other optimized GPU libraries.

  * rccl (ROCm Communication Collectives Library):
    
    * rccl is a specific library within the ROCm stack.
      
    * It is designed to provide optimized GPU communication primitives and collectives for parallel computing workloads.
      
    * rccl is used to improve communication and synchronization between GPUs in multi-GPU systems, making it particularly valuable for applications that require distributed GPU computing, like deep learning training on multiple GPUs.
      
    * This library enhances the performance and scalability of GPU-based parallel computing applications by providing efficient implementations of communication operations like reductions, broadcasts, and all-reduces across multiple GPUs.

When you install rocm-libs and rccl, you are essentially adding these GPU-accelerated libraries to your system. These libraries can be used by software applications and frameworks that require GPU acceleration and are compatible with ROCm, such as some machine learning frameworks and HPC applications.

```bash
sudo apt install rocm-libs rccl -y
```

11. Configure PATH. Add binary paths to the PATH environment variable.
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm-6.0.0/bin
```

## Check settings
1. Verify kernel-mode driver installation.
```bash
dkms status
```
2. Verify ROCm installation.
```bash
rocminfo
```

Example Result:
```bash
ROCk module is loaded

1. Create torch mamba environment
```bash
mamba create --name pytorch-rocm python=3.10 -y
mamba activate pytorch-rocm
```

2. Install [reference](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/install/install-pytorch.html)
```bash
wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-5.7/torch-2.0.1%2Brocm5.7-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-5.7/torchvision-0.15.2%2Brocm5.7-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
pip3 install --force-reinstall torch-2.0.1+rocm5.7-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl torchvision-0.15.2+rocm5.7-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl 
```

3. Verify if Pytorch is installed and detecting the GPU compute device.
```bash
python3 -c 'import torch' 2> /dev/null && echo 'Success' || echo 'Failure'
```

Result: 
```bash
Success
```

4. Enter command to test if the GPU is available.
```bash
python3 -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
```

Result:
```bash
True
```

5. Enter command to display installed GPU device name.
```bash
python3 -c "import torch; print(f'device name [0]:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

Result:
```bash
device name [0]: Radeon RX 7900 XTX
```

6. Run the preliminary hello world
```bash
python pytorch_mnist_numbers.py 
```

Result:
```bash
This is an experimnental Hello World using ROCm.
	PyTorch Version: 2.0.1+rocm5.7

```

### Tensorflow
1. Create tensorflow mamba environment
```bash
mamba create --name tensorflow-rocm python=3.10 -y
mamba activate tensorflow-rocm
```

2. Was told to use this build in lieu of all the other version issues recently experienced.
Issues encountered was missing comma keeping gfx1100 from being a valid card.
```bash
pip install http://ml-ci.amd.com:21096/job/tensorflow/job/nightly-rocmfork-develop-upstream/job/nightly-build-whl/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/packages-3.10/tf_nightly_rocm-2.16.0.600.dev20240109-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```

3. Had to install this library as well
```bash
pip install requests
```

4. Default way I test if tensorflow can see the GPU
```bash
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

5. Run the preliminary hello world
```bash
python tensorflow-rocm.py 
```

Result:
